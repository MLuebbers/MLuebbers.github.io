<p>This is an interactive web-sketch made only in HTML/CSS Flex boxes. It is a digital material investigation inspired by an exhibit on spider silk @ the <a href="https://risdmuseum.org/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/art-and-design-spider-silk">RISD Museum</a></p>
<p>I was trying to replicate several qualities of silken fabric in a browser context. Fits the inability to distinguish the depth of very thin filaments; they collapse onto 1 plane. Second, the tactile feeling of picking over the warp and weft with your fingers. Altering one thread has effect on its neighbors. Third, the effect of backing light thread as they begin to disappear in brighter light. I would suggest you see the effect when the site is projected onto a fabric.</p>
