<h1 class="page-section">Background</h1>
<p>This is a redesign of chapter 6 of Paul Ford's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#how-are-apps-made">&quot;What is Code?&quot;</a> for Bloomberg. The chapter focuses on dev tools and the large scale design of software. I wanted to redesign it for college students in their second year of programming. THey know how to code but might not be able to apply those skills to building software from scratch. What are the tools people actually use in the industry? I tried to keep the visual language consistent with documentation sites like MDN as well as popular tech platforms like iOS.</p>
