<h1 class="page-section">Background</h1>
<p>This is an experiment with the GSAP, an animation library for JS, and Scroll Magic. It is a study in the tweening properties of the library, as well as a comparative study in different forms motion through data-sampling.</p>

<p>I was originally going to do an pieces of interactive sports journalism about the 12th stage of the 2016 Tour de France. The Stage is dramatic for several reasons, but due to a high-profile crash at the end of the stage the overall standings were rearranged, forever solidifying a fork in the races timeline. You could trace out the lasting effects of the ruling throughout the rest of the Tour's last week. Here are the sketches:</p>

<h1 class="page-section">Results</h1>
<p>I've recently been interested in doing this kind of internet sketch with various technologies. Often times, getting the tools and libraries to do something conceptually interesting results involves breaking the tools, but it can also result in a better understanding of their limits and their inner workings. The result of the Zoetrope is certainly jank— in both good and bad ways. I wish the marquee background was smoother, and that development didn't feel so &quot;hacky&quot;, but I also think that— in some ways— the failure of GSAP and ScrollMagic to properly mirror the moving images is more illuminating and interesting than if the data points had been perfectly synced.</p>
