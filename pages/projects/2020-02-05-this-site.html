<h1 class="page-section">Background</h1>
<p>This is a static portfolio site, built using 11ty and Travis to build and push to GitHub. It's been integral in developing my design process. While it is a portfolio and I want my main projects and career information to be immediately available, I also want to encourage exploration and interaction with my work. Have a poke around.</p>
<p>I'm trying to wrestle with the fact that the sketch and mockup process isn't web-native. You can't interact with them, and they don't resize. You can spoof the interactivity with a &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; test, but it's just that— a spoof. I want to get to real websites as soon as possible, so I started by doing as many thumbnails as possible with a large sharpie. Detail is essentially impossible. There is no indication of what each shape is and how you can interact with it. This is just to get an idea for nice formal combinations and silhouettes. Then I move to larger half page sketches. Here I take a little longer, and get a feel for what the necessary elements of the site are and where they fit into the silhouette. A higher quality set of 2 or 3 sketches follows, to solidify the general shading and lighting.</p>
<p>The process helps me rely less on colors and typography and more on layout and spacing. The result is this site.</p>
