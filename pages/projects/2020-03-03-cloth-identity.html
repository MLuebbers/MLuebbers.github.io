<p>I've been messing around with mutable and generative brand identities recently and this is one of the results. Particularly I like the logo systems that morph over time; sometimes it will be readable, sometimes it won't. The system uses text as a very rudimentary bump-map for a cloth-like mesh. In orthographic perspective you can keep the horizontal lines parallel which would fit well in a website header. The brand isn't for anything in particular, but I might feature it more prominently on this site. I built a tool around it so you can see the system work with different inputs.</p>
