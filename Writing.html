            <p>
                In 1998, the music production world collectively lost its mind 37 seconds into Cher’s comeback single “Believe,” when her voice magically warbles in and out of tune for a split second. Following the release, there was widespread speculation about what effects processor or studio trickery could have created the now iconic sound that made the track an instant dance floor hit. Cher’s producers at the time were cagey about giving away any of their secrets for fear that other artists would be quick to copy. They even attempted to throw prying media off the scent by crediting the sound to vocoders and vocal synthesizers.

            <p>
                The truth about “Believe” was only revealed much later, when a producer on the track admitted they had used the studio pitch-correction software Auto-Tune. The software saw widespread use before the release of “Believe” but only for making minor alterations to a given track to polish vocal imperfections. Cher’s single would be the first harness its creative potential by pushing the software beyond its limits and making it correct Cher’s voice much faster and more aggressively than had ever been done in the studio up to that point. The result is unpredictable and robotic, yet infectiously catchy.

            <p>
                This glitchy, broken version of Auto-Tune, became ubiquitous in the late 2000s with major support from artists like T-Pain and Kanye West. It’s largely become a dirty word in the alternative music world today because of its connotation as a lazy fall-back for mediocre vocalists, but the public’s fascination with Auto-Tune reflects a general pattern in music that has been apparent since the early days of experimental and electronic music. We are enamored with unique audio glitches. They're bizarre quirks of modern day technology turned into sonic spice for any musical artist, popular or otherwise, and while Auto-Tune is a fairly recent development, there is a long lineage of experimentation leading up to Cher’s comeback hit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though these glitches are most often attributed to the rise of computers, the technique and theory behind them were being developed far before computers were ever used in music. The movement was spearheaded by Italian futurists in the early 1900s with the beginnings of noise music, but it was truly solidified by an American named John Cage. Generally credited as the most influential and important composer (perhaps even artist) of the 20th century, Cage was the grandfather of post-modern arrangement and Fluxus, a 1960s avant garde performance art movement that placed the conception of artistic ideas over the finished product. He influenced musicians from the Beatles to modern Japanese noise rock. His work eschewed established aesthetic limitations of the time to free sound from the grips of the composer. He embraced indeterminacy and randomness in his music to create pieces that are unreplicable and as close to nature as possible. Cage’s most famous work is “4:33” which, true to its name, involves 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence. In a filled concert hall, the ambient rustles of the audience become the composition.

            <p>
                The legendary Brian Eno also embrace the ambient possibilities of music albeit with the help of synthesizers and computers. In 1978, he released the landmark Ambient 1: Music for Airports, a sprawling, 48-minute tone piece that solidified ambient electronic music as a viable genre. While Eno is one of the most often cited influences for electronic musicians today, his most important contribution to glitch was his work with computer generated music in the 1990s. To achieve his goal of truly “ambient” works, he had to find a way for his music to play infinitely, without end. The solution lay in computer algorithms that systematically produced compositions by altering and adding onto existing progressions and melodies. While Eno’s pieces are for the most part peaceful and understated, his work still borrowed concepts from John Cage’s more dissonant work and further added to the foundations of more established glitch music entering the 1990s and 2000s. Embracing the innate and unique qualities of different sounds over their arrangement and composition, both Eno and Cage were unknowingly the forefathers of a movement of producers and artists that incorporated deliberate malfunctions and technological quirks into their musical work.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the Robert Moog and Donald Buchla released the first modular synthesizers to the general public in 1964, musicians first wanted to replicate already existing instruments, hoping that it would legitimize the new technology. The Moog Synthesizer’s first major breakthrough came in the form of Brown graduate Wendy Carlos’s 1968 classical album, Switched on Bach.  However, artists soon discovered that the most exciting possibilities for synthesizers lay outside the realm of what the general public understood to be “musical.” Electronic musicians were now deliberately acknowledging the limitations and affordances of the technology in their music. Japanese musician Yasunao Tone embodies this formalist approach to electronic music. Once a member of Fluxus, Tone pioneered Japanese noise music by producing a series of ear-shredding pieces throughout the '90s, his most famous being Solo For Wounded CD in ‘97. Tone practiced a kind of musical kintsugi, the art of repairing broken objects. His creative process would involve damaging CDs and stitching their various malfunctions and erratic sounds back together to form a new piece. While Tone’s music is certainly hard to listen to, the German group, Oval, took inspiration from his methods and produced more accessible work by further arranging and editing the sounds. It was a departure from Cages teachings of indeterminacy, but it was a necessary step in legitimizing the possibilities of glitch in the greater musical community. Oval was still niche, but it laid the groundwork for the popularization of glitch techniques.

                By the late 2000s the inclusion of technological imperfections in music had become both intentional and mainstream. The end of the decade saw the release of “Heartless” by Kanye West, and “Boom Boom Pow” by the Black-Eyed Peas. Both tracks would take cues from Cher’s “Believe” and aggressively pitch correct the vocal tracks. “Boom Boom Pow” would additionally use stutter effects to create a staccato, robotic effect. Both tracks would become pop classics, but even beyond the realm of hip-hop, artists were experimenting with the newer possibilities. The 2010s saw a rise in Dubstep and other EDM sub-genres that embraced unpredictable industrial sounds and broken vocals. Even folk groups began turn to the computer. Bon Iver released the EP Blood Bank in 2009 in the same year as “Boom Boom Pow”. The EP’s final track, “Woods”, was a far-cry from the group’s previous work, featuring only Justin Vernon’s voice, pitch shifted and corrected to create intricate harmonies and intriguing pitch modulations. Kanye West had taken notice of Bon Iver by this point, and the two artists began collaborating. West’s 2010 record, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, featured “Woods” as a prominent sample on the track “ Lost in The World”. The two mutually influenced each other for the next half-decade, resulting in perhaps the most mainstream glitch albums to date: Bon Iver’s 22, A Million in 2016. Despite the group's previous electronic experimentation, many fans were surprised by the dominance of synths and vocal samples, replacing the traditional acoustic instrumentation. 22, A Million relied on many of the techniques the group had been developing over the past decade. Sound engineer Chris Messina even created a new instrument that acted as a harmonizer and was responsible for many of the watery, resonant, choral lines throughout the album. It was a sound unlike anything listeners had heard before.

                The electronic glitch is unique and often unable to be replicated, due to its accidental and experimental creation. Glitch artists, and now even mainstream musicians have allowed nature to take hold of technology, one of Cage’s driving theories. The appeal of Cher’s unnatural warble lies in its own unpredictability. When used properly, the glitch catches our attention, but only long enough to pique our curiosity. Gone in an instant, we are left to wonder whether it was there on purpose, when it will come back, and how the sound was even created. True glitch music will never fully catch on; it’s too dissonant, and for the mainstream consumer, there isn’t much substance. But, lessons can be learned from these niche artists like Eno and Oval. Despite the seemingly endless cycle of predictable pop songs, some of the most well remembered and respected are the ones that poke at the boundaries of what's been done before, often taking cues from lesser-known artists. Many casual listeners will forget that the Beatles, the most recognizable pop act in the world, borrowed elements from French experimental music of the 1950s, and  pushed music as a whole towards experimentation and psychedelia in the late 60s. My hope is that the same will happen again for Cher, and now Bon Iver and Kanye West. They are prominent voices in the music industry and popular taste, for better or worse, tends to follow prominent voices.

            <a id="A1" href="http://www.bsidemagazine.org/features-1/2016/11/7/american-football-releases-a-new-american-football-for-the-third-time-and-the-first-time-in-seventeen-years">American Football Releases A New American Football For The Third Time And The First Time In Seventeen Years</a><br>
            <p>
            To many, the arrival of a new American Football album seemed like an impossible dream -- until now. The Chicago group crafted a meandering emo opus that would become a cult hit years after its initial 1999 release, and its haunting, strung-out grooves have been the soundtrack to so many adolescent memories since: late-night drives, hazy house parties, and heartbreaking loss. While the production and lyrics were amateur, their improvised and off the cuff nature created an instantly relatable and sincere record.
            </p>
            <p>
            Hopes of a new release were heightened in 2014 when the original trio - made up of guitarists Mike Kinsella and Steve Holmes and drummer Steve Lamos - announced a set of reunion shows, their first since the original LP’s release in 1999. But with the  excitement came significant trepidation. The opening lick of “Never Meant” and the famous cover photo of what is now simply referred to as the ‘American Football House’ have become iconic in indie rock and emo circles, and it was unclear whether a second release would eradicate the mystique of the original or build upon their legendary work from two decades ago.
            <p>
            </p>
            American Football was conceived quickly as a slapped together “art project” at the University of Illinois by Kinsella, Holmes, and Lamos. Their sound was equally informed by post-hardcore acts, like Slint and Kinsella’s own Cap’n Jazz, and minimalistic folk artists like Elliott Smith. While they had played in bands in high school, Kinsella was originally a drummer, and the group owned very little equipment to record on. Their makeshift recordings of half-improvised songs, primarily recorded in a few days as the group was preparing to leave college, have a sense of spontaneity and serendipity that makes the album grounded in a specific time with a specific purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
            Originally totally unaware of their monumental influence on an entire genre, the group still seems surprised by the meteoric success of American Football (LP1) since their hiatus. Next to their 90’s emo contemporaries like Brain and The Promise Ring, American Football has risen to the top over the course of nearly two decades of radio silence. When the members realized how unexpectedly beloved they had become, they quickly re-released LP1. Their label’s site was crashed from the traffic. After some consideration, the band announced two reunion shows in 2014, adding experienced Bassist and cousin, Nate Kinsella,  and fittingly starting in Champaign, Illinois, site of the famed ‘American Football House.’
            </p>
            <p>
            Kinsella would be the only original member to carry on his musical career with any notoriety, forming the acoustic solo act Owen. He would go on to produce a prolific series of heartbreaking folk albums, a far cry from the thrasher and progressive sounds of Cap’n Jazz and American Football respectively. For those not familiar with Owen, the new American Football LP might introduce surprising and potentially unwelcome changes to their signature sound. For one, Kinsella’s voice is more resonant and takes a prominent place in the mix, opposed to the relatively back-mic’d vocals of the original. And while its does sound like a small change, the richer production on the new record changes its tone completely putting a stronger focus on Kinsella’s lyrics.
            </p>
            <p>
            LP2 is certainly a more mature record due to its lyrical content and modernized production. While the angst of the original LP remains, it’s grown-up, and the themes are noticeably more adult. While LP1’s lyrics were by no means well written, it fit in nicely with the rest of the instrumentation. On the new album, however, Kinsella’s cliches are a little too apparent. “Give Me the Gun” and “I Need a Drink (or Two or Three)” seem a little too heavy-handed in their imagery, a sharp contrast from the original’s apparent ambiguity, and Owen’s own deep vulnerability and sincerity.
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite the changes in lyrical content and production, the arrangements themselves are unmistakably American Football. Guitars chime in complex grooves that take several minutes to play out fully and often clash with the unconventional and syncopated rhythms of Lamos’s drumming. The album as a whole has nice sense of space. Rarely does it ever feel rushed, instead it just stretches, allowing the riffs to morph and shift naturally. Some new sounds do make a welcome appearance later on in the album too: Bell-like vocal harmonies mix well with their signature ringing harmonics on songs like on “Born to Lose,” and some unfamiliar guitar tones are utilized including lush vibrato bends which feel distinctly “Surfy.”
            </p>
            <p>
            It would be easy to dismiss LP2 as a cash grab, but Kinsella and company seem to genuinely be having fun with a college project they thought had died a long time ago. It truly feels like four midlife crises getting the band back together to see if they’ve still got it, and they certainly do. Each track is as wispy and rhythmic as the originals, and Kinsella still speaks in eloquent deepities that while ultimately meaningless are equally sincere. Now with a new coat of paint, the group that was seemingly never meant to be has made it to the forefront of emo for the first time in its two decade long lifespan.
