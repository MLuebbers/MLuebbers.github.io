    I am Creative Developer and Sound Designer based in Chicago, with work 
    ranging from professional software development to audio visual performance 
    pieces to post-production audio. My primary personal work centers on 
    exploring interactive audio-visuals systems, with my more recent work in 
    games as frameworks for musical improvisation. I occasionally produce and 
    perform music under my own name or as Protection Spells for more dance-oriented 
    work. Live-projection and graphics work is often done under these monikers as well.

    I studied Computer Science and music at Brown University in Providence Rhode Island, 
    with additional coursework in Linguistics and Visual Art.

    I did graduate studies in Sound for the Moving Image at Glasgow School of Art 
    in Scotland.
