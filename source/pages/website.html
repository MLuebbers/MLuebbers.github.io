    I’ve maintained a personal website for about 6 years at this 
    point, generally dedicating time around the holidays and early/late summer 
    to keeping it updated. When I was working in software development, this 
    schedule sort of fell apart and I left it unmaintained for several years. 
    Even when I was working on it biannually, There was usually some 
    unnecessary heavy lifting that had to be. Such is the constant shifting 
    nature of web development that the. Discovery of a new tool prompted an 
    overhaul of the sites architecture. In an effort to streamline the process 
    of adding projects, I used increasingly complex static site generation 
    stacks which I would promptly forget how use in the intervening college 
    semesters, and. Would have spend several days getting back up to speed 
    before I invariably became dissatisfied with the tools I was using and how 
    I designed the sight several months before and would opt to. On top of this, 
    I rarely work in the same medium, and many projects require which a 
    over-engineered build process tended to make difficult. I want this site to 
    be a playground which facilitates more exploration with format.

    To that end I have opted to build most of this site out with basic 
    templating on a single page to make it easier to get to grips with when 
    I sporadically return to update a project. Of course this also resists 
    the urge when I return to break everything down, Although I have done 
    professional web development in the past, and for some years the web was 
    my platform of choice, I don’t currently consider my job to be web 
    development and so I’m not actively keeping with the tools du jour.

    I use gulp to facilitate html partials. I'd prefer that
    this site be fast, clean, and easily extensible for when I need to add 
    new project. Becasue the nature of my work is varied, I've tried to not tie myself 
    into any particulr layout.

    This site is a largely chronological collection of works and loose thoughts, 
    and upcoming events. I’d like to keep that dichotomy fuzzy, so tense is loose
    throughout all writing, sections on older projects are likely to remain at the
    bottom of the page, unless some relevant development makes them fundamentally a
    new project. I will make edits in the past tense.

    With that said: the obligatory this-site-is-still-in-progress, and always will be; theres's a lot of text to go through.
