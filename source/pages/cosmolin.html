    The Cosmolin was the creative result of my Master's research and was 
    developed in August 2023. I have done a significant amount of writing
    on the topic of games as frameworks for musical expression and I will
    be adding this writing serially to this page as I will be revising it
    with fresh eyes.

    The first iteration was a single composition and proof-of-concept 
    which was shown in Septermber 2023. I am currently optimizing and 
    porting the project from Unity to the open source engine Godot for 
    a possible wider release.

    The abstract for the project is below:

    This project explores the musical possibility of games beyond 
    experiencing soundscapes, or imitating musical performance. The 
    role of the designer and game system as both obstacles and motivators, 
    opens up co-creative possibilities through the play of video games.

    It presents the game as an inherently resistive interactive system 
    which refutes the ideal of the frictionless interface. The game can 
    act as musical Instrument and score through which the human performer, 
    game system, and developer enter into creative and emergent 
    a/synchronous dialogue. Games as instruments of play define their own 
    economy and ecology through which certain sounds, and gestures are 
    afforded.

    It identifies strategies for further investigation through the design 
    and development of a sound-based game.
