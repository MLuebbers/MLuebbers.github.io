    I have been thinking a lot about artificial scarcity recently. There is a 
    constant rumbling of crypto and NFTs under the surface of experimental 
    music right now, which state the value of the work is in its scarcity, 
    and that the only way to maintain music's (or any other digital art’s) 
    value is to make the platforms enforce scarcity rather than consider the 
    different forms in which the work can only exist in a limited number or on 
    specific platforms.

    I had a conversation with a collaborator recently about YouTube, which he 
    believed would devalue his music. I prickled at this suggestion having 
    grown up digging endlessly through musicians back-catalogs late into the 
    night. Like MTV before it, YouTube became the source for music videos, and 
    directly influenced the expression of my art. I view image, performance, 
    design and sound as integral parts of the music package. If music was viewed 
    separate from its existence within a larger context— sound on disc— of course 
    infinite portability and replicability would be a threat.

    Vinyl publication is truly scarce on a physical level, with some runs being 
    only a couple hundred records. Like mixtapes, they work well as an art object 
    to passed around and disseminated in a particular locale. That’s not to 
    position analog and/or physical media above internet or digital versions of 
    the same work. I have benefited from this ecosystem ever since I started to 
    create sound, and it has informed my listening habits, and sampling practice. 
    In fact I view Mono as a celebration of the formal differences of each storage 
    media. With the release of an upcoming album, I have been considering how to 
    add value to my work on each platform it exists on that is native to that 
    platform.

    I’ve also been inspired by vinyl’s uniquely tactile nature. Other physical 
    storage media for sound such as music boxes, wax cylinders, and punchcards 
    do not maintain momentum like a record on a direct-drive turntable. This, I 
    believe, makes the vinyl record an inherently musical storage device that 
    can be played like an instrument. I hope to perform this work with live 
    sampling/looping and effects processing, with a video record of the 
    performance and the 3 discs living on as secondary record— a tool for future 
    performances that can be passed on to other artists.

    Aside from the materials used, Mono was made entirely by hand with only a 
    ruler, craft knife, and a tungsten carbide scribe. The anti-skate records 
    had to be sourced from eBay in a small lot, therefore the economic and environmental 
    viability of the project long-term is called into question. I intend to make 
    these on-demand by hand following the patterns I etched on the first set of records 
    as long as I have vinyl blanks available, after which the project will be on hiatus.

    The score dictates the structure of performance. Rules which define the realization 
    of the sound become frameworks of expression. In traditional engraving, emphasis is
    placed on the readability and replication. Given careful design for ease of reading 
    and the understandable restrictions of written instructions for musicality, seams 
    begin to open through which the performer can emerge, establishing themselves as 
    either collaborator or antagonist. Discovering less traditional methods of scoring, 
    we began to see these seams become pockets, but still the score remains— physically 
    and sonically. If the score shifted from framework to tool, we’d begin to see 
    something more like an instrument. The flute or drum presents its own rules of 
    interaction while allowing the user to stretch the limits of the pocket with altered 
    techniques. Vinyl lives on as the most accessible and portable physical storage media. 
    It can be written to by the user with simple tools It’s also radial, meaning beats and 
    loops can be easily created. Digital and magnetic storage media allow for relatively 
    easy and accurate replication but by engraving by hand, time and craft are reintroduced 
    to recorded media. The luthier can experiment and tweak the sound and playability 
    with each instrument they create. They create an archeology of their instruments.
