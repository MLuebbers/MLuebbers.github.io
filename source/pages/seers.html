    Seers was a interactive tone piece built in April 2020 as prologue to a
    wider story I have yet to return to. In a world which has gone grey 
    during the heat death of the universe, the Seers pluck the now visible 
    spirits and memories from the air to rebuild society.

    Seers interacted with your filesystem picking and displaying photos from your machine
    as you build web-like structures across the landscape.
    Security roadblocks made this difficult to make more widely available at the time.

    All programming, modelling, animation, and audio for this project was done solo.
