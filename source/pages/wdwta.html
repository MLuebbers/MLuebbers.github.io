    <i>Why Don't We Talk Anymore?</i> is a open-format club-night organized by myself and Rhiannon SÃ­an Clucas first put on at Nice N Sleazy in Glasgow Scotland.
    The concept was based on Rhiannon's own artistic practice. I won't go into the details of her research here, but her developed visual language centered on the derelict
    phone booths scattered around Glasgow, as a metaphor for growing alienation. We felt that a club-night unrestrained from genre could be the site for physical 
    connection. We played Ambient, Bass, Techno, Hard-House, Pop Edits and Hardcore. Rhiannon's scans of old burner phones served as the basis for most of the visuals.

    We are currently planning to continue the mixes as an international livestream and hope to open up to a wider variety of artists.
