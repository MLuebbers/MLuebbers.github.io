    This winter, I hear the sound of songbirds when I wake up in the middle of the 
    night. Coming from America, this is a completely new and surreal experience 
    for me. Soundscapes I would associate with late mornings in springtime have 
    flapped their way into my hazy recollections of stumbling to the bathroom 
    during the dead hours of a cold, drizzly, January night.

    My entire rhythm feels off recently; my internal clock is set to the changing of 
    the seasons, but with the mildness of the Glasgow winter I find few temporal 
    landmarks to hold on to. The blackbird's song flits around at the edges of my 
    consciousness, like a dream; it’s too early for anyone to be up, and it’s not 
    time for the daffodils to sprout through the last patches of snow. Noise pollution 
    and light pollution have undoubtedly effected the patterns of living for both 
    humans and non-humans. The clouds hanging low in the sky reflect the city in a 
    strange way, lighting up the sky at night, bright stars set against a black sky 
    give way to the murky gradients of browns and purples, it reminded me of a quote 
    from William Gibson’s Neuromancer “[The sky] was the color of television, tuned 
    to a dead channel.”

    I have treated the concept of “clips” a little differently for this project. 
    First, the slowly oscillating gradients have been generated live in Max, creating 
    indiscernibly shifting patterns within a cloud of graininess. These gradients 
    are selected from a list of hand- designed presets. Second, I’ve filmed the 
    interference patterns of a light shining through water projected against a wall. 
    The water itself is a highly complex system and the smallest of movements send 
    giant ripples and unpredictable after-images across the screen. These water 
    caustics are just one long video made up of several clips strung together, 
    constantly playing in the background but randomly being brought to the foreground 
    using linear envelopes and transparency— as if to wing itself out of the darkness 
    and disappear before you know what you’ve seen.

    The sound of blackbirds and nightingales are created from randomly selecting a 
    clip to play at a specific volume and with certain filter characteristics, this 
    creates a better illusion of space, and makes the repeat clips a little less 
    noticeable with the added variation. The specifc clip is chosen at random 
    selecting every clip at least once before it can be selected again. The clips 
    are triggered by an impulse train object, whose tempo oscillates between several 
    triggers per second to one every ten seconds. This creates a natural ebb and flow 
    of intensity. Since the clips generally have different rhythms to them and begin 
    at different times, the effect is still natural and doesn’t sound sequenced. To 
    add subtle variations, I transition between random sets of parameters roughly with
    each cut to a new image.

    I have been fascinated in the application of noise throughout out all my projects 
    for its psycho-acoustic and psycho-visual affects. When filtered and modulated 
    correctly, noise sources are incredibly versatile and can take on any source we 
    prescribe to them. Noises interaction with the sounds around it are complex and 
    our brains— trying to make sense of the noise— begin to attribute the subtle 
    variations to different imagined sources. Just while creating this piece, I began 
    to hear the sound of the freeway, the muffled sound of wind and the rumble of a 
    truck going past. The grain in the video is completely faked too but serves the 
    same purpose; it can produce odd figures in the dark as the mind tries to reconcile 
    the lack of information. I like to play with how information peeks out through 
    entropy like this. Above the cacophony of city life, the birds have adapted to the 
    changes in climate and the changes in the urban soundscape to announce themselves 
    through my nightly dreams.

    Overall there isn’t that much complexity in the models of chance working here to 
    select the clips, but the pacing and fine-tuning of parameters was key to 
    achieving a natural, dream-like feel to the visuals, and a believable, 
    non-repeating soundscape for the audio. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the 
    clips themselves and a lot of effort put into finding the most natural way to 
    transition them. I believe this dream-like “space-telling” vs. story-telling is 
    specifically well-suited for this generative film structure. While a lot of 
    complexity and content was left on the cutting room floor, I felt like the end 
    result was more focused, and I count this project as a success as it is the first 
    time I felt like I was really “painting” with Max.
