    In the 1950â€™s, during the process of making the St. Lawerence river more 
    traversable for large ships heading to the great lakes, a series of dams 
    and locks were built. To deepen and widen the river, channels where cut 
    into the river bed and a whole section of rapids called the Long Sault had 
    to be flooded. Caught in the flooding was a set of towns now called the 
    Lost Villages. The existance of these towns is now hidden because they have 
    been completely submerged in the river, but they can be seen via satellite 
    images. I stumbled across these images in the fall on a whim after I had a 
    vague memory about my mom telling me this story when I was younger. The 
    photos are striking as you can clearly see old roads and buildings 
    underneath the water. What I found most impactful were the places I 
    rememeber visiting as a child, where certain side roads abruptly vanished 
    into the water. What I once thought to be a simple boat launch at the town 
    beach is in reality a road that stretches the width of the river and crosses 
    the border into Canada.

    I wanted to capture the sound I remember of swimming in the river, my head 
    submerged, hearing the deep vibrations eminanating from the enourmous ocean-going 
    ships all the way on the other side of the channel. I wanted to capture the 
    feeling of routing through old photos, of dredging up clay from the river bed,
    of frantically trying to collect memories before they slip like water out of my 
    head.

    Technically I was exploring the posibilities of using web sctructures and interfaces
    for perforing musical pieces and their ability to engage a player with the thematic 
    content of the piece more directly. Ultimately, there are better technologies for 
    adding audio to websites, and for adding interactive visuals to live sets, 
    but the fundamental ideas explored in this project make up the later foundation for Cosmolin.
