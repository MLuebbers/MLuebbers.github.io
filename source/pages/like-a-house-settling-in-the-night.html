    Like a house settling in the night, was a project developed and performed 
    entirely in Max's patching window using Max's built-in patcher "reflection" 
    objects, allowing me to move objects around the window, make new connections 
    and destroy objects.

    At the time I was exploring ideas of memory, and how they become rewired, 
    distorted and ultimately complete fabrications over time. The slow 
    demolition of the patch itself reflects this. It's an idea I hope to return 
    to at some point in the future.
